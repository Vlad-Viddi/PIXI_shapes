# PIXI_shapes

## Implemented:

- The falling speed is controlled by Gravity Value, which can be managed (speed up "+" and speed down "-"). This controller is below game area;
- Random shape with random color will be generated on click on mouse position inside game area, and this shape starts falling;
- To increase quantity on shapes generating per second there is a control pad (increase quantity "+" and decrease quantity "-") next to Gravity Value controller;
